before any js is runned, browser runs the "global execution context"
	the GEC create the "global object" and the "this" keyword

this is where the malloc happens

then comes the execution phase, and this is where the code is executed

basicly what that means is that, like in C, function declaration should be at the top

about scope :
	when a variable is not define, the execution goes one scope higher till it finds the variable

when you call a function, a new execution context is created with it's own keyword "this"
	(just like how the stack works in C)
	called Callstack in js
