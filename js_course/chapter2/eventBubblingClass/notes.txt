DOM == Document Object Model
	used to access html/css code through js
it is an object oriented representation of your html/css code
that you can access through the "document" object

for exemple:
	document.title = 'whatever' let's you change title of the page

difference between HTMLCollection and NodeList
HTMLCollection can only have node "elements" (<h1>, <a>, class etc)
where NodeList can also hold node text, node comment

so with NodeList you can even get the actual text on your index.html
use nodeItems.children to get elements only

other difference :
	querySellector does not "update" it's returned value if you make changes
	so if you add new item, he keeps the array.length the same

	but if you use .children method to a NodeList, it then returns an HTMLcollection
	so no worries

	so you can use querySellector with .children methods to easily change things

EVENTS:
	when usr do something, exec code
	events can be things like click, scroll, resizing the browzer
