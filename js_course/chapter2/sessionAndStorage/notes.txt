JSON == JavaScript Object Notation
API == Application Programming Interface

the only thing you can pass to localStorage are strings

when using local storage you give a key and a value;
if you use same key, value gets replaced by new one

SEEMS LIKE the main difference between arrays and object is:
	array have only 1 key for all the values;
	objects have 1 key for each values;
